Fourth Quarter 2025

Net sales increased 14% to $213.4 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with $187.8 billion in fourth quarter 2024. Excluding the $2.8 billion favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 12% compared with fourth quarter 2024.

Fourth quarter 2025 operating income includes three special charges—$1.1 billion for the resolution of tax disputes associated with our stores business in Italy, and the settlement of a lawsuit, $730 million in estimated severance costs, and $610 million in asset impairments primarily related to physical stores. Without these charges, operating income would have been $27.4 billion.

International segment operating income was $1.0 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in fourth quarter 2024.

Full Year 2025

Net sales increased 12% to $716.9 billion in 2025, compared with $638.0 billion in 2024. Excluding the $4.4 billion favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the year, net sales increased 12% compared with 2024.

"AWS growing 24% (our fastest growth in 13 quarters), Advertising growing 22%, Stores growing briskly across North America and International, our chips business growing triple digit percentages year-over-year—this growth is happening because we're continuing to innovate at a rapid rate, and identify and knock down customer problems," said Andy Jassy, President and CEO, Amazon. "With such strong demand for our existing offerings and seminal opportunities like AI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites, we expect to invest about $200 billion in capital expenditures across Amazon in 2026, and anticipate strong long-term return on invested capital."
Some other highlights since the company's last earnings announcement include that Amazon:

Announced new AWS agreements with OpenAI, Visa, the NBA, BlackRock, Perplexity, Lyft, United Airlines, DoorDash, Salesforce, U.S. Air Force, Adobe, Thomson Reuters, AT&T, S&P Global, National Bank of Canada, London Stock Exchange Group, Choice Hotels, Accenture, Indeed, HSBC, CrowdStrike, and more.
Continued gaining significant momentum with AWS custom chips:

Trainium and Graviton now have a combined annual revenue run rate of over $10 billion and growing at a triple digit percentage year-over-year.
Trainium2 is fully subscribed with 1.4 million chips landed, and powers the majority of inference on Bedrock, a service used by 100,000+ companies.
Trainium2 powers Project Rainier, the world's largest operational AI compute cluster with 500,000+ Trainium2 chips, which Anthropic is using to train its industry-leading AI model, Claude.
Trainium3 is now delivering production workloads and seeing strong demand, with nearly all Trainium3 supply of chips expected to be committed by mid-2026.
Trainium4 is expected to start delivering in 2027, with 6 times the FP4 compute performance, 4 times more memory bandwidth, and 2 times more high memory bandwidth capacity than Trainium3.


Introduced Graviton5, AWS's most powerful and advanced CPU for a broad set of cloud workloads. Used by over 90% of the top 1,000 AWS customers, Graviton is up to 40% more price-performant than leading x86 processors, and enables applications to run faster, reduce costs, and meet sustainability goals.
Added 20+ fully-managed models on Amazon Bedrock, including from Amazon Nova as well as Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, NVIDIA, Qwen, Mistral AI, Stability AI, Cohere, MiniMax AI, and Moonshot AI—enabling customers to test and switch between models without rewriting code while accessing breakthrough capabilities in coding, reasoning, and agentic workflows.
Expanded its family of Nova models, including Nova 2 Lite and Nova 2 Pro for frontier intelligence with lower costs and latency, and Nova 2 Sonic for multilingual conversational AI.
Introduced Nova Forge, a first-of-its-kind service that empowers organizations to build their own optimized variants of Nova by pre-training the model with their own proprietary data early in the process.
Introduced Nova Act for building and managing reliable AI agents for UI-based workflows.
Introduced new capabilities for Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, AWS's pioneering set of infrastructure building blocks for developers and companies to build secure, scalable agents, including:

AgentCore Policy to help block unauthorized agent actions that operate outside the agent code and check agent actions against policies in milliseconds.
AgentCore Evaluations to trigger immediate alerts if a customer service agent's satisfaction scores drop rapidly, helping enable swift response.
AgentCore Memory to help agents learn from experiences and improve decision-making, reducing processing time and the need for extensive custom instructions.


Launched a new class of AI agents, called frontier agents, to solve tasks more autonomously and over longer durations, including:

Kiro agent that can autonomously handle a range of tasks—from triaging bugs to improving code coverage. Customers can ask it questions, describe a task, and assign tasks in their backlog, and the agent will independently figure it out and get the work done.
AWS Security Agent that embeds deep security expertise throughout the development lifecycle, proactively reviewing design documents and scanning pull requests against organizational security requirements and common vulnerabilities. It also transforms penetration testing from a slow, manual process into an on-demand capability, matching the team's development velocity.
AWS DevOps Agent that helps resolve and proactively prevent incidents.


Announced new agentic capabilities in AWS Transform to accelerate organization-wide code and application modernization across any code, API, framework, runtime, architecture, language, and even company-specific programming languages and frameworks. AWS Transform has also helped customers analyze 1.8 billion lines of mainframe code since launch.
Launched new agentic AI capabilities for Amazon Connect—an AI tool that enables contact centers to provide consistent, personalized customer experiences—including advanced speech models, agentic assistance, AI-powered recommendations, and AI agent observability. Connect is a $1 billion annualized revenue run rate business growing over 30%, and has an average of 20 million+ interactions happening on it each day.
Introduced AWS AI Factories to transform customers' existing data centers into high-performance AI environments, which accelerates AI buildouts by months or years compared to building independently.
Delivered at fastest speeds ever for Prime members globally in 2025.
Continued increasing speed for rural customers in the U.S., with the average number of monthly customers receiving same-day delivery in rural areas nearly doubling year-over-year.
Delivered nearly 70% more items same day in the U.S. than the year before, with Same-Day Delivery used by nearly 100 million customers.
Expanded Amazon Now ultra-fast delivery, which offers delivery on thousands of items in 30 minutes or less. Amazon Now is now available in various cities in India, Mexico, and the UAE, and is being tested in several communities in the U.S. and UK.
Expanded Same-Day grocery delivery to 2,300+ cities and towns across the U.S., making fresh groceries more accessible and transforming how customers shop for food, with perishables making up 9 of the top 10 most-ordered items in areas where the service is available.
Expanded Amazon Pharmacy Same-Day Delivery, with same-day delivery of prescriptions now available in 3,000+ U.S. cities and towns.
Made Rufus—Amazon's agentic AI shopping assistant—smarter, more capable, and more helpful. Rufus can shop tens of millions of items in other online stores directly and make purchases on behalf of customers using its agentic Buy For Me feature. Rufus was used by 300 million+ customers and saw an even stronger response than anticipated, helping deliver nearly $12 billion in incremental annualized sales last year.
Saw strong adoption of Lens—an AI tool that helps customers find products with a phone camera, screen shot, or bar code—with customers using it 45% more year-over-year.
Was named the lowest-priced U.S. retailer by Profitero for the ninth year in a row, with online prices on average 14% lower than other major U.S. retailers.
Increased selection on Amazon Haul in the U.S. to 1 million+ items under $10, with many under $5, and expanded to serve customers in 25+ countries and regions.
Broke several records with the fourth season of Thursday Night Football on Prime Video, the most-watched season of Thursday Night Football ever, averaging 15 million+ viewers—a 16% increase year-over-year and third consecutive year of double-digit growth.
Had the most-streamed NFL game in history with 31 million+ viewers watching the Packers vs. Bears Wild Card Playoff game, clearing the prior record by 4 million+.
Debuted NBA on Prime in more than 200 countries, including streaming exclusive coverage of the Emirates NBA Cup, culminating with the Spurs vs. Knicks Championship, which averaged 3 million+ viewers and attracted the youngest-ever audience for a Cup Championship, according to Nielsen.
Extended broadcast rights for UEFA Champions League in Germany, Ireland, Italy, and the UK through 2030/31 season. This follows continued strong viewership, including a record-breaking 10 million+ viewers streaming League Phase matches on Prime Video in Germany, Ireland, and the UK in a single evening.
Announced that Alexa+ is available to all customers in the U.S. for $19.99 per month as a standalone subscription, and free for Prime members. Customers without Prime can try the Alexa+ chat experience for free at Alexa.com.

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of February 5, 2026, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and energy prices, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies, resource and supply volatility, including for memory chips, and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.
First Quarter 2026 Guidance

Net sales are expected to be between $173.5 billion and $178.5 billion, or to grow between 11% and 15% compared with first quarter 2025. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 180 basis points from foreign exchange rates.
Operating income is expected to be between $16.5 billion and $21.5 billion, compared with $18.4 billion in first quarter 2025. This guidance includes approximately $1 billion of higher year-over-year Amazon Leo costs as we scale in 2026, as well as investment in quick commerce and even sharper prices in our international stores business.
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.

Conference Call Information
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
Forward-Looking Statements
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security incidents, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
